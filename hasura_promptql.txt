can u tell me , in above codes
is there any usage of promptql of hasura 
please explain

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In the code you provided, there is no direct usage or integration of PromptQL of Hasura.

Explanation of the Current Code
Here’s what your current setup is doing:

Imports:

You're using Streamlit for the interface.
PromptTemplate, RunnablePassthrough, and ChatGoogleGenerativeAI are imported from LangChain and the Google GenAI package.
Prompt Setup:

A system message (system) is defined for the LLM, telling it it can issue search queries if necessary, although it's not actually doing any search in your case.
PromptTemplate creates a prompt template with an input variable question.
LLM Initialization:

The ChatGoogleGenerativeAI instance (llm) is initialized to communicate with the gemini-1.5-pro model from Google Generative AI. No specific tools or databases are connected.
Query Analyzer Pipeline:

A query pipeline (query_analyzer) is created using RunnablePassthrough and PromptTemplate.
This pipeline does not interact with any databases; it simply sends the input directly to the LLM, formats it with the prompt template, and then gets the response from the LLM.
Streamlit Interface:

The Streamlit UI captures user input, sends it to the LLM via the defined pipeline, and then displays the response.
What is PromptQL of Hasura?
PromptQL is a query language feature from Hasura that lets you construct GraphQL queries dynamically and interact with your database through natural language or prompt-based inputs.
It's often used to integrate an LLM with a Hasura GraphQL endpoint to enable database querying based on user prompts.
Why Is There No PromptQL Usage in Your Code?
No GraphQL Interaction: The code does not include any GraphQL client or API endpoint to interact with Hasura.
No Database Setup: There are no configurations for connecting to a Hasura backend or using PromptQL to dynamically construct queries.
LLM Use Only: The focus of your code is purely on interacting with a language model (gemini-1.5-pro) to get natural language responses, without querying a database.
How to Integrate PromptQL of Hasura
If you want to integrate PromptQL with Hasura, you would typically need to:

Connect to Hasura: Use a GraphQL client (like gql or requests in Python) to interact with your Hasura backend.
Use PromptQL: Instruct the LLM to generate GraphQL queries based on user input and then execute those queries against the Hasura API.
Fetch Data: Handle the database response and present it back to the user through Streamlit.
Let me know if you want an example of how to integrate PromptQL with your current setup!

To integrate PromptQL of Hasura into your existing code and make the LLM interact with a Hasura GraphQL backend, I'll demonstrate an example where the LLM generates a query based on user input, sends it to Hasura, and displays the database results in your Streamlit app.

Use Case
Let's assume you want the user to ask questions about data stored in a Hasura database. For example, asking about product details from a products table in a database managed by Hasura.

Assumptions
You have a Hasura GraphQL endpoint set up.
You have an API key or authorization token for accessing the Hasura API.
You have a products table with columns like id, name, price, and category.
Steps
Prompt the LLM to generate a GraphQL query using PromptQL.
Send the query to the Hasura endpoint using a GraphQL client.
Display the results in Streamlit.
Required Dependencies
You need to install the following Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit langchain-google-genai gql requests
Modified Code
Here’s the code with Hasura integration using PromptQL:

python
Copy code
import streamlit as st
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
import requests
from gql import Client, gql
from gql.transport.requests import RequestsHTTPTransport

# Define your Hasura GraphQL endpoint and authorization token
HASURA_URL = "https://your-hasura-instance.herokuapp.com/v1/graphql"  # Replace with your Hasura URL
HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET = "YOUR_HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET"  # Replace with your Hasura admin secret or API key

# Set up the Hasura GraphQL client
transport = RequestsHTTPTransport(
    url=HASURA_URL,
    headers={
        "x-hasura-admin-secret": HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    use_json=True
)
client = Client(transport=transport, fetch_schema_from_transport=True)

# Define system message for the prompt
system = """You need to generate a GraphQL query to fetch data from a Hasura database.
Generate a query based on user questions to get relevant information."""

# Create the prompt template
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["question"],
    template=f"{system}\nHuman: {{question}}"
)

# Initialize the LLM without any tools
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-1.5-pro", google_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Structured LLM for processing the prompt
structured_llm = llm  # Using LLM directly without additional tools

# Query analyzer pipeline setup
query_analyzer = {"question": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | structured_llm

# Streamlit Interface
st.title("Chat with LLM using Hasura PromptQL")
st.write("Ask a question about the products database:")

# User input
user_input = st.text_input("Ask a question:")

# Button to submit the question
if st.button("Submit"):
    if user_input:
        try:
            # Use .invoke() to get the GraphQL query from the LLM
            result = query_analyzer.invoke({"question": user_input})

            # Assuming the result is a GraphQL query string
            if isinstance(result, str):
                graphql_query = result
            elif hasattr(result, 'content'):
                graphql_query = result.content
            else:
                graphql_query = str(result)

            st.write("Generated GraphQL Query:", graphql_query)

            # Execute the GraphQL query using the Hasura client
            try:
                query = gql(graphql_query)
                response = client.execute(query)
                st.write("Query Result:", response)
            except Exception as e:
                st.error(f"An error occurred when executing the query: {str(e)}")
                
        except Exception as e:
            st.error(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
    else:
        st.warning("Please enter a question.")
Key Changes:
Hasura GraphQL Client Setup:

Used gql and requests to connect to the Hasura GraphQL API.
Provided HASURA_URL and HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET for secure connection.
LLM Interaction:

The LLM now generates a GraphQL query based on user input.
The generated query is then used to fetch data from the Hasura database.
GraphQL Query Execution:

After generating the query, it's executed using the gql client.
The results are displayed in the Streamlit app.
Instructions
Replace placeholders (YOUR_API_KEY, YOUR_HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET, and https://your-hasura-instance.herokuapp.com) with actual values.
Run Streamlit:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run your_script_name.py
Test by asking questions that the LLM can interpret into meaningful GraphQL queries, such as:
"Show me the products in category 'Electronics'."
"What is the price of the product with id 10?"
Let me know if you have any specific database queries or use cases, and I can tailor the code accordingly!






You said:
Define your Hasura GraphQL endpoint and authorization token
can we define it by any way the Hasura GraphQL endpoint free ,without any subscription
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can use Hasura's free tier to set up a GraphQL endpoint without requiring a paid subscription. Here's how you can set up a free Hasura GraphQL endpoint and access it without a paid subscription:

Steps to Set Up a Free Hasura GraphQL Endpoint
Deploy Hasura for Free:

You can use platforms like Render, Heroku, or Vercel to deploy a Hasura instance for free.
Alternatively, you can run Hasura locally or use Hasura Cloud, which offers a free tier.
Hasura Cloud (Free Tier):

Visit Hasura Cloud and create a free account.
After signing in, create a new project.
You will get a GraphQL endpoint URL like:
bash
Copy code
https://your-project-name.hasura.app/v1/graphql
In Hasura Cloud, you can set up databases (like PostgreSQL) without needing a paid subscription.
Local Deployment:

Install Docker if you haven't already.
Use the following command to run a local Hasura instance:
bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 hasura/graphql-engine:latest
Access your local Hasura console at http://localhost:8080.
For a local database, you can use PostgreSQL, which you can set up locally or through free cloud options like ElephantSQL.
Setting Authorization
If you use a free deployment (e.g., Hasura Cloud), the endpoint might require an admin secret for security.
If no security is configured, you can access it without an authorization token, but it's generally recommended to use an admin secret.
Configuration without a Paid Subscription
To set up the Hasura GraphQL client for a free deployment, you can follow these examples:

Example 1: Using Hasura Cloud Free Tier (with Admin Secret)
Replace the placeholders in the Python code as shown:

python
Copy code
# Replace these with your own free Hasura Cloud endpoint and admin secret
HASURA_URL = "https://your-project-name.hasura.app/v1/graphql"  # Your Hasura Cloud URL
HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET = "your-admin-secret"  # Admin secret from Hasura Cloud
Example 2: Using a Local Hasura Deployment (No Admin Secret)
If you are running Hasura locally without an admin secret, you can configure the client without a security token:

python
Copy code
# Local Hasura endpoint (no admin secret required if running locally)
HASURA_URL = "http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql"
HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET = ""  # Leave empty if not using a secret
Running Hasura without Subscription
Hasura offers free access through:

Hasura Cloud (Free tier available).
Local Deployment (No subscription needed).
Free Cloud Hosting on platforms like Heroku or Render.
Security Tips
Admin Secret: It's best to use an admin secret, even in the free tier, to secure your endpoint.

Environment Variables: Store sensitive information like API keys or secrets in environment variables instead of hardcoding them. Example:

python
Copy code
import os

HASURA_URL = os.getenv("HASURA_URL")
HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET = os.getenv("HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET")
Access Control: Configure role-based access controls (RBAC) in the Hasura console to limit access to your data, even if you're using a free endpoint.

Getting Your Hasura Admin Secret
In Hasura Cloud:

Go to your project dashboard.
Navigate to Settings → GraphQL API.
Find the Admin Secret section, and copy it.
In Local Deployment:

You can start Hasura with an environment variable specifying the admin secret:
bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET=mysecretpassword hasura/graphql-engine:latest
By following these steps, you can access and set up a free Hasura GraphQL endpoint. Let me know if you need help deploying or configuring the endpoint!
