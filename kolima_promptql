pip install streamlit langchain-google-genai gql requests


To integrate PromptQL of Hasura into your existing code and make the LLM interact with a Hasura GraphQL backend, 
I'll demonstrate an example where the LLM generates a query based on user input, sends it to Hasura, and 
displays the database results in your Streamlit app.

Use Case
Let's assume you want the user to ask questions about data stored in a Hasura database. 
For example, asking about product details from a products table in a database managed by Hasura.

Assumptions
You have a Hasura GraphQL endpoint set up.
You have an API key or authorization token for accessing the Hasura API.
You have a products table with columns like id, name, price, and category.
Steps
Prompt the LLM to generate a GraphQL query using PromptQL.
Send the query to the Hasura endpoint using a GraphQL client.
Display the results in Streamlit.
Required Dependencies
You need to install the following Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit langchain-google-genai gql requests
Modified Code
Here’s the code with Hasura integration using PromptQL:

python
Copy code
import streamlit as st
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
import requests
from gql import Client, gql
from gql.transport.requests import RequestsHTTPTransport

# Define your Hasura GraphQL endpoint and authorization token
HASURA_URL = "https://your-hasura-instance.herokuapp.com/v1/graphql"  # Replace with your Hasura URL
HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET = "YOUR_HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET"  # Replace with your Hasura admin secret or API key

# Set up the Hasura GraphQL client
transport = RequestsHTTPTransport(
    url=HASURA_URL,
    headers={
        "x-hasura-admin-secret": HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    use_json=True
)
client = Client(transport=transport, fetch_schema_from_transport=True)

# Define system message for the prompt
system = """You need to generate a GraphQL query to fetch data from a Hasura database.
Generate a query based on user questions to get relevant information."""

# Create the prompt template
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["question"],
    template=f"{system}\nHuman: {{question}}"
)

# Initialize the LLM without any tools
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-1.5-pro", google_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Structured LLM for processing the prompt
structured_llm = llm  # Using LLM directly without additional tools

# Query analyzer pipeline setup
query_analyzer = {"question": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | structured_llm

# Streamlit Interface
st.title("Chat with LLM using Hasura PromptQL")
st.write("Ask a question about the products database:")

# User input
user_input = st.text_input("Ask a question:")

# Button to submit the question
if st.button("Submit"):
    if user_input:
        try:
            # Use .invoke() to get the GraphQL query from the LLM
            result = query_analyzer.invoke({"question": user_input})

            # Assuming the result is a GraphQL query string
            if isinstance(result, str):
                graphql_query = result
            elif hasattr(result, 'content'):
                graphql_query = result.content
            else:
                graphql_query = str(result)

            st.write("Generated GraphQL Query:", graphql_query)

            # Execute the GraphQL query using the Hasura client
            try:
                query = gql(graphql_query)
                response = client.execute(query)
                st.write("Query Result:", response)
            except Exception as e:
                st.error(f"An error occurred when executing the query: {str(e)}")
                
        except Exception as e:
            st.error(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
    else:
        st.warning("Please enter a question.")
Key Changes:
Hasura GraphQL Client Setup:

Used gql and requests to connect to the Hasura GraphQL API.
Provided HASURA_URL and HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET for secure connection.
LLM Interaction:

The LLM now generates a GraphQL query based on user input.
The generated query is then used to fetch data from the Hasura database.
GraphQL Query Execution:

After generating the query, it's executed using the gql client.
The results are displayed in the Streamlit app.
Instructions
Replace placeholders (YOUR_API_KEY, YOUR_HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET, and https://your-hasura-instance.herokuapp.com) with actual values.
Run Streamlit:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run your_script_name.py
Test by asking questions that the LLM can interpret into meaningful GraphQL queries, such as:
"Show me the products in category 'Electronics'."
"What is the price of the product with id 10?"
Let me know if you have any specific database queries or use cases, and I can tailor the code accordingly!

can we use kolima to work on codes , with prompt ql hasura
ChatGPT said:

Kolima is another platform similar to Hasura that can handle GraphQL databases. If you're looking to use Kolima (or a similar service) with PromptQL of Hasura to execute GraphQL queries and interact with data, you can certainly integrate it into your workflow. However, Kolima itself is not directly associated with Hasura's PromptQL—PromptQL is specifically a feature designed for generating GraphQL queries using natural language prompts within Hasura.

Options to Integrate Kolima with PromptQL-like Functionality
If you want a setup that mimics what PromptQL does (i.e., allowing natural language to control GraphQL queries) but using Kolima, here's a breakdown:

1. Using Kolima as a Backend for GraphQL
Kolima can act as the backend, hosting the database, and you can interact with it through a GraphQL endpoint. Then, you can use a LLM (like LangChain with Google Generative AI) to generate GraphQL queries dynamically and execute them against the Kolima GraphQL API.

2. Simulating PromptQL with Kolima
While PromptQL is native to Hasura, you can simulate its behavior with Kolima by:

Using LLMs to generate GraphQL queries based on user input.
Sending the generated queries to Kolima's GraphQL endpoint.
Fetching the data and displaying it to the user through a Streamlit interface.
Implementation Example
Assuming you have a Kolima GraphQL endpoint, here's an example of how you can set up a similar workflow:

Step-by-Step Code Example
Generate GraphQL queries dynamically using an LLM.
Send the queries to Kolima.
Display the results in a Streamlit app.
Modified Code for Kolima
Here's how you can modify your previous example to interact with Kolima:

python
Copy code
import streamlit as st
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
import requests
from gql import Client, gql
from gql.transport.requests import RequestsHTTPTransport

# Define your Kolima GraphQL endpoint and any necessary authorization token
KOLIMA_URL = "https://your-kolima-instance.com/v1/graphql"  # Replace with your Kolima GraphQL URL
KOLIMA_AUTH_TOKEN = "YOUR_KOLIMA_AUTH_TOKEN"  # Replace with your Kolima auth token if needed

# Set up the Kolima GraphQL client
transport = RequestsHTTPTransport(
    url=KOLIMA_URL,
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {KOLIMA_AUTH_TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    use_json=True
)
client = Client(transport=transport, fetch_schema_from_transport=True)

# Define system message for the prompt
system = """You need to generate a GraphQL query to fetch data from a Kolima database.
Generate a query based on user questions to get relevant information."""

# Create the prompt template
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["question"],
    template=f"{system}\nHuman: {{question}}"
)

# Initialize the LLM without any tools
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-1.5-pro", google_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Structured LLM for processing the prompt
structured_llm = llm  # Using LLM directly without additional tools

# Query analyzer pipeline setup
query_analyzer = {"question": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | structured_llm

# Streamlit Interface
st.title("Chat with LLM using Kolima GraphQL")
st.write("Ask a question about the database hosted on Kolima:")

# User input
user_input = st.text_input("Ask a question:")

# Button to submit the question
if st.button("Submit"):
    if user_input:
        try:
            # Use .invoke() to get the GraphQL query from the LLM
            result = query_analyzer.invoke({"question": user_input})

            # Assuming the result is a GraphQL query string
            if isinstance(result, str):
                graphql_query = result
            elif hasattr(result, 'content'):
                graphql_query = result.content
            else:
                graphql_query = str(result)

            st.write("Generated GraphQL Query:", graphql_query)

            # Execute the GraphQL query using the Kolima client
            try:
                query = gql(graphql_query)
                response = client.execute(query)
                st.write("Query Result:", response)
            except Exception as e:
                st.error(f"An error occurred when executing the query: {str(e)}")
                
        except Exception as e:
            st.error(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
    else:
        st.warning("Please enter a question.")
Key Points
Kolima GraphQL Setup:

The KOLIMA_URL should point to your Kolima GraphQL endpoint.
If Kolima requires authentication, provide the KOLIMA_AUTH_TOKEN.
Prompt Template:

The prompt instructs the LLM to generate GraphQL queries to interact with Kolima.
This is similar to what PromptQL does in Hasura, but it's now tailored for Kolima.
GraphQL Execution:

The generated GraphQL query from the LLM is executed using the gql library against the Kolima endpoint.
Results are shown in the Streamlit interface.
Advantages of this Approach
You get similar PromptQL functionality using LLMs without being restricted to Hasura.
Kolima integration gives you flexibility to choose other database management services while still leveraging dynamic GraphQL queries.
Additional Considerations
Make sure Kolima has a GraphQL schema accessible to your LLM. This might involve some schema exposure for the LLM to understand the structure.
Implement security best practices such as hiding tokens in environment variables.

Kolima is not a commonly known open-source GraphQL platform or service like Hasura. It might be a specialized or proprietary solution if you have a specific service in mind. If you were referring to Hasura or another open-source GraphQL server, I can provide guidance on how to set up and use them.

If You Are Looking for an Open-Source Alternative
Here are some common open-source GraphQL solutions and how to get the endpoint and tokens:

1. Hasura (Open Source)
Hasura is a well-known open-source GraphQL engine that can be hosted locally or on the cloud.
You can set it up using Docker or directly through platforms like Heroku.
How to Set Up Hasura:
Local Setup with Docker:
bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 hasura/graphql-engine:latest
Access your local Hasura console at http://localhost:8080.
Getting Hasura GraphQL Endpoint & Admin Token:
Your GraphQL endpoint will be http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql if running locally.
If you deploy to Hasura Cloud, you’ll receive a URL like https://your-project-name.hasura.app/v1/graphql.
Admin Secret (authorization token) can be set during setup:
In Docker, add HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET:
bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET=mysecretpassword hasura/graphql-engine:latest
In Hasura Cloud, go to your project settings and configure an admin secret.
2. Apollo Server (Open Source)
Apollo Server is another popular choice for setting up a GraphQL API.
It's a Node.js-based GraphQL server, which you can run locally or deploy on cloud platforms like Heroku or Vercel.
How to Set Up Apollo Server:
Install Node.js.
Install Apollo Server:
bash
Copy code
npm install apollo-server graphql
Create a simple Apollo Server setup in server.js:
javascript
Copy code
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');

// A sample schema
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello World!',
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${url}`);
});
Run the server:
bash
Copy code
node server.js
Your GraphQL endpoint will be something like http://localhost:4000/graphql.
3. GraphQL Yoga (Open Source)
GraphQL Yoga is a fully-featured GraphQL server that’s also open source and easy to set up.
Installation:
bash
Copy code
npm install graphql-yoga
Create a server:
javascript
Copy code
const { GraphQLServer } = require('graphql-yoga');

const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    hello(name: String): String!
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: (_, { name }) => `Hello ${name || 'World'}`,
  },
};

const server = new GraphQLServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
server.start(() => console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:4000'));
GraphQL endpoint: http://localhost:4000.
How to Access GraphQL Tokens
If your GraphQL service requires an authorization token (like Hasura's admin secret):

Local Setup:
You usually set it during configuration, like setting the HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET for Hasura.
Cloud Setup:
Log into the platform's dashboard (like Hasura Cloud).
Go to your project settings or API settings to retrieve or set the admin token.
Using Open-Source GraphQL with a Free Service
You can also deploy open-source GraphQL servers on free hosting platforms:

Heroku: Free tier available for deploying apps.
Render: Offers a free plan for hosting web services.
Vercel: Great for serverless deployments with a free plan.
If Kolima Is a Specific Platform
If Kolima is a specific platform or service:

Check the Documentation: Refer to any official documentation for endpoint configuration.
Sign Up: Create an account if they provide a cloud-based service.
Access Endpoint: Typically, after setting up a project, you’ll be given a GraphQL endpoint.
API Key/Token: Check if they require an API key or authorization token for accessing the endpoint.
Let me know if you were referring to a different service or if you want more detailed instructions on setting up a specific GraphQL service!





===========

from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI

system = """You have the ability to issue search queries to get information to help answer user information.

You do not NEED to look things up. If you don't need to, then just respond normally."""
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", system),
        ("human", "{question}"),
    ]
)
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-1.5-pro", google_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
structured_llm = llm.bind_tools([Search])
query_analyzer = {"question": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | structured_llm


===================

This code creates a query_analyzer object that can be used to analyze user questions and generate search queries. The query_analyzer object takes a dictionary as input, with the key "question" set to the user's question. The query_analyzer object then uses the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to generate a search query, which can then be used to retrieve information from a search engine.

Here is an example of how to use the query_analyzer object:

python
Copy
question = "What is the capital of France?"
result = query_analyzer({"question": question})
search_query = result["search_query"]
The search_query variable will contain the search query that was generated by the Gemini 1.5 Pro model. This search query can then be used to retrieve information from a search engine

In this example, PromptQL is used to create a prompt that is used to generate search queries. The prompt is defined in a way that allows the LLM to use its knowledge of the world to generate search queries that are relevant to the user's question.
